About the app:
The RickAndMorty App allows its user to search through all characters to every appear on the television show. The user can filter search by searching for a status (Dead, Alive, or Unknown) and a species (Human, Humaniod, Alien, etc) and then toggling the picker between male and female characters with those qualities. To view the filtered search after inputting a status and species, toggle between male and female to load the filtered results. After selecting a character, the user can view a photo, a colored graphic to indicate the status (green for alive, red for dead/unknown), and a More Information tab that tells the character's type (if indicated) and the character's last known location from the series.


About the API:
We chose this API because it was very easy to read. It allowed us to easily choose which characteristics we wanted to include for each character, which ones we should note as optional, and how each one is used. The API clearly states each key, its type, and description in a table on its website that was very helpful while setting up the app. After searching through multiple APIs, we found that the RickAndMorty API was the most clear to understand and would be the easiest to implement in our app.
